# Airline Routes

This is a sample data set for the D3.js chord visualizer. The data comes from 
[OpenFlights.org](http://openflights.org/data.html). Provided 
[ETL pipeline](./airline_routes_etl_pipeline.jsonld) automatically fetches data from their web
site and converts it into RDF which can be then directly fed to the visualizer.

The data set is fairly large consisting of 10 000 airports (nodes) and almost 70 000 routes (edges).
